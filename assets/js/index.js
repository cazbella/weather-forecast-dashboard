To create the weather dashboard, you'll need to use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data based on city coordinates. You can obtain coordinates by making a separate API call to the Geocoding API, using the city name.

Here's a general guide on how to proceed:

1. //Get API Key

2. //Set Up HTML and CSS
   //Create a form for city input and a section to display weather information.
   //Style your dashboard using css

3. //JavaScript 
   //handle user input and make API requests.
   //Retrieve city coordinates by making a Geocoding API call using the city name.

4. //Fetch Weather Data
   //Use the obtained coordinates to make a request to the 5 Day Weather Forecast API.
   //Extract and display relevant information like city name, date, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

5. //LocalStorage for Search History
   //Store the searched cities in the localStorage
   //Display the search history on the dashboard?

6. //Display 5-Day Forecast
   //Parse the API response to show the 5-day forecast with date, weather conditions, temperature, and humidity

7. //Handle Search History Click
   //Implement functionality to handle clicks on the search history
   //Display the weather information for the selected city

8. //autofill for city names? is there a way to get a list of names to correspond with weather api? 
//make cards for each day dynamically createded using jquery. 

9. //responsiveness - use percentages and media queries and flexbox or dynamically create bootstrap elements.
